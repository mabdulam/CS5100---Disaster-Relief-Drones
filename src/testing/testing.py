testing_3.py

A comprehensive script for visualizing drone coverage and performing an
emergency pathfinding demonstration within a grid environment. This file
utilizes PyGame for a graphical animation showcasing how multiple drones
scan a grid, gather local obstacle information, stitch this data into a
global map, and finally run an A* pathfinding routine to locate an emergency
location from the grid's origin (0, 0).

Main Features:
--------------
1. **Random Environment Generation**: Creates a 2D grid of size `grid_size Ã— grid_size`
   with randomly distributed obstacles based on `obstacle_prob`. Cells can be:
   - SAFE (1)
   - OBSTACLE (0)
   - UNEXPLORED (-1)

2. **Drone Simulation**:
   - Multiple drones (each has a center `(x, y)` and a scanning size).
   - Each drone "scans" a local area, revealing SAFE vs. OBSTACLE states.
   - Drone data merges into a global map, marking cells as SAFE or OBSTACLE
     if not already known.

3. **Animated Visualization**:
   - Iteratively reveals drone coverage areas with semi-transparent highlights.
   - Provides an info panel to display coverage statistics, exploration progress,
     and the discovered path to an emergency location.

4. **Emergency Pathfinding**:
   - Identifies or randomly selects an "emergency location" from the known SAFE cells.
   - Runs an A* algorithm from start (0, 0) to this location, if possible.
   - Visualizes the resulting path on the grid with colored cells.

5. **Controls**:
   - Spacebar: Toggle play/pause of drone coverage animation.
   - 'R': Reset the entire simulation's coverage data and pathfinding state.
   - 'P': Attempt pathfinding to an emergency location if enough coverage is available.
   - '+' / '-': Adjust the animation speed.
   - 'Esc': Quit the visualization.

Usage:
------
1. Generate or obtain a JSON file containing drone positions and sizes (e.g.,
   "drone_coverage_results_20.json").
2. Run: `python testing_3.py <grid_size>`
   - e.g. `python testing_3.py 20`
3. The script attempts to load "drone_coverage_results_<grid_size>.json". If found,
   it animates coverage and pathfinding with the specified drones.

Dependencies:
-------------
- Python 3.x
- pygame (for graphical display)
- numpy (for array operations)
- json, random, time, sys, os (standard library modules)
